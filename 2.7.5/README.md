# Veilforge — Fog of War (DM Tool)

Veilforge is a lightweight desktop tool for tabletop RPGs that lets a DM reveal a map progressively (“fog of war”), project it to a second screen for players, and add quick annotations on top.

## Version 2.7.5 highlights

- Update interface version with an audacious **Tactical Studio** UI direction.
- Keeps all heavy-video protections introduced previously (heavy detection, lite profile, VP9 4K safeguard, 1080p cache transcode attempt).

## Features

- **Fog of War** painting (reveal / hide)
- **Player Screen** output (second monitor / projector, fullscreen)
- **Grid overlay** with adjustable size, offset and alpha
- **Annotations** (draw on top) with brush size + alpha + color picker
- **Video/audio support**: open `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.mkv`, `.m4a` files for playback on the DM canvas and player screen
- **Tokens**: import token images, then move/resize/rotate them on the DM map
- **FOV / Cone tools** (visual field templates)
- **Undo / Redo**, save/load sessions

## Quick Start

1. **Open Map** and pick an image (PNG/JPG).
2. Select the **Target screen** (your projector / second monitor) from the dropdown.
3. Click **Player Screen: ON** to enable the player view (use **Fullscreen** if desired).
4. Use **Fog brush** to reveal areas while you narrate.

## Video / Audio maps

- You can now open video or audio files directly as the map source.
- Supported formats include **MP4**, **WEBM**, **MKV**, and **M4A**.
- When a video file is loaded, playback starts automatically and loops on the DM canvas and player screen.

### Video playback limitations and stability notes

- Very heavy videos (notably **4K** and/or high bitrate files) can saturate decode/render resources on some PCs.
- In these cases, Windows can temporarily mark the app as **"Not responding"**.

Built-in mitigations:
- Heavy-video detection with user warning (size + 4K hints, and codec/resolution metadata when available).
- Automatic **lite render profile** (lower frame processing load + stronger display downscale).
- **VP9 4K** streams force lite profile automatically.
- For every detected heavy video, Veilforge attempts a local **1080p cached transcode** when `ffmpeg` is available.

Best practice:
- Prefer 1080p assets for long sessions, or prepare a lighter version of very large video maps.

## Projector / Second Screen calibration

### 1) Pick the right screen
- Use **Target screen** to choose the monitor/projector resolution you want.
- If the player view shows up on the wrong display, pick the other entry and toggle Player Screen OFF/ON once.

### 2) Fullscreen vs Windowed
- **Fullscreen** is ideal for projectors and TVs.
- Windowed can be useful while calibrating or if your OS fights fullscreen positioning.

## Grid alignment

The grid is meant to match the map’s grid (or your physical table grid).

- **Grid size** changes the cell size (pixels per square).
- **Grid offset X/Y** moves the grid to match the map lines.
- **Grid alpha** controls transparency (higher = more visible).

**Workflow tip**
1. Set a rough grid size first.
2. Then fine-tune **offset X/Y** until the lines lock in perfectly.
3. Finally adjust **alpha** so it’s visible but not screaming.

## Fog brush

Fog is a mask over the map. The brush edits the mask.

- **Brush size**: radius of the fog tool.
- **Brush alpha/strength** (if present): how strongly you reveal/hide per stroke.
- Use **Undo Fog / Redo Fog** for quick corrections.
- **Reset Fog** returns the whole map to fully fogged (or default mask state).

## DM zoom navigation (Master screen)

- Use the **mouse wheel** to zoom on the DM map.
- Use **middle mouse drag** to pan inside the zoomed image.
- When zoom level is above 100% and movement is possible, Veilforge shows:
  - a **horizontal scrollbar** at the bottom
  - a **vertical scrollbar** on the right
- Those bars let the DM move quickly through the zoomed map area.

## Tokens

Tokens are image markers placed on top of the map (creatures, NPCs, props, effects).

- Click **Import Token** to load one or multiple `.png` / `.jpg` token images.
- Imported tokens are auto-arranged around map center with spacing (not stacked).
- Token size is normalized on import for visibility, and can be adjusted with **Parameters > Token import scale**.
- Multi-import spacing can be adjusted with **Parameters > Token batch spacing**.
- Enable **Token tool** to manipulate tokens on the DM canvas:
  - Drag token body: move
  - Blue handle icon (top-right): resize
  - Orange handle icon (above token): rotate
- Right-click a selected token to open the context menu:
  - **Undo** / **Redo**
  - **Rotate** / **Resize**
  - **Copy** / **Paste** / **Delete**
- Keyboard shortcuts for tokens:
  - **Ctrl + Z**: undo token action
  - **Ctrl + Y**: redo token action
  - **Ctrl + C**: copy selected token
  - **Ctrl + V**: paste copied token
- **Delete** or **Backspace**: remove selected token
- Tokens are synchronized to the **Player** window.
- On the Player side, tokens stay hidden under fogged areas (fog is drawn above tokens).

Important behavior:
- When **Token tool** is ON, the DM fog brush is intentionally disabled (including brush preview) to prevent accidental fog edits.

## FOV (Field of View) tools

FOV tools are “templates” to quickly show what a character can see.

- Circle / cone / directional shapes (depending on the build)
- Great for stealth / dungeon corners / torchlight vibes
- Adjust parameters (radius/angle) and place on the map

## Annotations

Annotations are “ink” drawn on top of everything (map + fog).  
They are meant for quick, temporary markings during play:

- traps, doors, enemy positions
- arrows, circles, tactical notes
- reminders during combat or exploration

Controls:
- **Color**: pick the pen color
- **Size**: pen thickness
- **Alpha**: transparency (lower = subtle, higher = solid)

### Erasing annotations (important)

There are **two different ways** to erase annotations:

#### 1) Partial erase (brush-style)

- Hold **CTRL** and use **RIGHT mouse button** on the map
- This works like an eraser brush
- Only the area you paint over is removed

Use this when you want to clean or adjust a small part of a drawing.

#### 2) Delete annotation button

- Click **Delete annotation** → deletes the **last annotation stroke**
- **CTRL + click** on **Delete annotation** → deletes **ALL annotations** (with confirmation)

Use this when you want to quickly undo the last drawing or reset all annotations at once.

### Delete annotation button

- Click **Delete annotation** button → deletes the **last stroke**
- **CTRL + click** → deletes **all** annotations (with confirmation)

## Sessions (Save / Load)

- **Save / Save As** stores your current state:
  - map path
  - fog mask
  - grid settings
  - annotations
  - tokens (image, position, size, rotation)
  - other view settings

Missing file recovery:
- On **Load Session**, if map/media path is not found, Veilforge first searches in the session file folder.
- If still missing, a file picker asks you to locate the required file.
- Once selected, the new location is remembered for future loads.

Picker visibility note:
- In file search dialogs, `.json` session files are explicitly listed in the main filter so they are visible without switching filters.

Parameters note:
- **Parameters** includes a configurable default folder for **Save/Load Session**.
- **Parameters** includes **Token batch spacing** for multi-token import placement.
- Dialog text uses a high-contrast style for better readability.

Use **Load Session** to resume later exactly where you left off.

## Keyboard / Shortcuts

- Standard OS shortcuts work where applicable.
- Some actions use **modifier keys** (example: **CTRL** with “Delete annotation”).
